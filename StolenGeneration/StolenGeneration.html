    <h1> The Stolen Generation</h1>
    <p>Stolen generation started in 1910. When white people settled in, the government at that time removed tones of children from their family to be raised by a white foster family or institution.</p>

<h2>What is stolen generation and who or what started it?</h2>
<p>Stolen generation was one of the cruelest past history that was in 1910 to 1970's the aborigines has ever faced. Children were removed from their family by the rules / laws Australian federal and state government made. 10% ~ 33% of the aborigines famiy has lost contact with their family and taken to the insitution or to a non-indigenous family. The Protection ACT gave the power of Protection Board (retain the welfare of 9000 aborigines living in NSW) in the NSW to remove indigenous childs from their blood born family. </p>

<h2>Sorry Day</h2>
<em>Kevin Rudd the Prime Minister started the Sorry Day</em>
<p>On 13th of February, 2008 Kevin Rudd made an apology to the indigenous australian for the past Stolen Generation. He said in the Parliment House "I move:
That today we honour the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures in human history.
We reflect on their past mistreatment.
We reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were Stolen Generationsâ€”this blemished chapter in our nation's history.
The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.
We apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.
We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country.
For the pain, suffering, and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry.
To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry.
And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry.
We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation.
For the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written.
We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.
A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again.
A future where we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement, and economic opportunity.
A future where we embrace the possibility of new solutions to enduring problems where old approaches have failed.
A future based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility.
A future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia." The speech made all the past indigenous people sad in a good way. All this years (more then 100), no one has said sorry to them even when the Stolen Generation ended. So from then, they made a day known as "Nation Sorry Day" that is held in Wednesday, 26 May to remember the mistreatment of the Stolen Generation by seperating their children, parent and their families.</p>

<h2>On-going effect</h2>
<p>
<ul>



<li>From the past, indigenous people were treated unfairly sometimes cause of their colour. Even when the past has ended, still some people's comfort is affected by the indigenous people's skin colour.</li>
<ol>
  <li>46% of the aborigines due to the internet, can't get a job cause of its skin and for some of them that didnt get a paid job, they are likely to be starved and living on the streets.</li>
</ol>
<li>the Stolen Generation Protection Act lead to forcibly seperating the children, their parents and families and it causing depression right now for the Aborigines that are still alive that was part of the Stolen Generation.</li>
